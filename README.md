# Patient-medication-ML-project
The purpose of this project is to develop a data-driven approach to optimize the process of determining which medications are prescribed to individual patients. This will be achieved by advanced data analytics techniques, machine learning algorithms, and healthcare data sources. I aim to find the most effective and accurate predictive model that can assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions regarding medication prescriptions.
## Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Weka

- K-Means Clustering

- Naive Bayes Classification

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Summary
I cleaned and analyzed a patient dataset, visualized data relationships using Weka, and applied multiple ML algorithms to predict medication needs. 
Naive Bayes achieved the highest accuracy for classification tasks, while K-Means was effective in identifying patient clusters.
